### Conceptual model: Recap

- A conceptual model is a high level description of:
    - "the proposed system in terms of a set of integrated ideas and concepts about what it should do, behave and look like, that will be understandable by the users in the manner intended"

### Conceptual models based on activities: Recap

- **Giving instructions**
    - issuing commands using keyboard and function keys and selecting options via menus
- **Conversing**
    - interacting with the system as if having a conversation
    > 如果技术100%成熟，那么对话型可等同于指令型。技术成熟到何种程度可以投入使用，取决于实际操作中的一些标准。经过用户情景分析的85%可能优于不做任何分析的98%，因为可以规避剩下的15%，而技术的极限就是98%
- **Manipulating and navigating**
    - acting on objects and interacting with virtual objects
- **Exploring and browsing**
    - finding out and learning things

### Conceptual models based on objects: Recap

- Usually based on an analogy with something in the physical world
- Examples include books, tools, vehicles
- Classic: Xerox Star Interface based on office objects

### Interface metaphors: Recap

- Interface designed to be similar to a physical entity but also has own properties
    - e.g. desktop metaphor, web portals
- Can be based on activity, object or a combination of both
    - e.g. W3 is an ocean.(surfing, drowning in a sea of information)
- Exploit user's familiar knowledge, helping them to understand 'the unfamiliar'
- Conjures up the essence of the unfamiliar activity, enabling users to leverage of this to understand more aspects of the unfamiliar functionality

# Interaction Styles

### Conceptual models: from interaction mode to style

- **Interaction mode**:
    - what the user is doing when interacting with a system, e.g. instructing, talking, browsing or other
- **Interaction style**:
    - the kind of interface used to support the mode, e.g. speech, menu-based, gesture

### Many kinds of interaction styles available

- Command Line
- Menu-Based Interface
- Form Fill-In
- Question and Answer
- Direct Manipulation
- Metaphors
- Web Navigation
- Three-Dimensional Environments
- Zoomable Interface
- Natural Language

### Which interaction style to choose?

- Need to determine requirements and user needs
    > 从用户需求出发，而非从技术出发
- Take the budget and other constraints into account
- Also will depend on suitability of technology for activity being supported
- This topic will be covered more later when discuss how to actually design conceptual models

### Interaction styles: Command Line

- Command-Line interfaces are fast and powerful.
    - Many commands are abbreviated
        - quick and efficient
    - Commands can be applied to many objects simultaneously
        - fast input
    - Some commands have multiple parameters that can be set and altered
        - precise and flexible
- Command Line and the EEAC
    - Intention formation, specification of the action, and the execution stages are complex
    - Requires a rather accurate mental model of the computer's internal processing
- Command Line and the Interaction Framework
    - Translating the user's task language into the input language requires knowledge of the core language
    - The output language can be confusing for inexperienced users - there is very little feedback
- Advantages of command-line interfaces:
    - Suitable for repetitive tasks
    - Advantageous for expert users
    - Offer direct access to system functionality
    - Efficient and powerful
    - Not encumbered with graphic controls
        - Low visual load
        - Not taxing on system resources
- Disadvantages of command-line interfaces:
    - Steep learning curve
    - High error rates
    - Heavy reliance on memory
    - Frustrating for novice users

### Interaction styles: Menu-Based Interface

- Menu-driven interfaces present users with sequential hierarchal menus that offer lists of functions
    - Textual: key-in number of option
    - Graphical: use arrow keys or pointing device
- MAXIM: Menus are based on recognition as opposed to recall
    > 尽量利用用户的认知而非记忆

    - No need to remember commands
    - User search from a list of possible choices
    - List provides constraints
    - Appropriate for small screens (iPad)
- Menu-based interfaces and Affordances
    - Menu elements present affordances
- Most menus are a variation on a few basic categories:
    - Single
    - Sequential
    - Hierarchal
    - Star network
    - Web network
- Advantages of menu-based interfaces:
    - Low memory requirements
    - Self-explanatory
    - Easy to undo errors
    - Appropriate for beginners
- Disadvantages of menu-based interfaces:
    - Rigid and inflexible navigation
        > 刚性设计

    - Inefficient for large menu navigation
    - Inefficient use of screen real estate
    - Slow for expert users

### Interaction styles: Form Fill-In

- MAXIM: Always inform the user about the length of paged forms and where they are within the structure
    - Forms can be presented using
        - Single scrolling screens
        - Multiple linked pages
    - Form elements must be grouped logically
    - Include "You Are Here" indications
- MAXIM: Form elements must be unambiguously labeled to increase data integrity
    - Users must understand what data is required and what format should be used
        - Date information formats
- Advantages of form fill-in interfaces:
    - Low memory requirements
    - Self-explanatory
    - Can gather a great deal of information in little space
    - Present a context for input information
- Disadvantages of form fill-in interfaces:
    - Require valid input in valid format
    - Require familiarity with interface controls
    - Can be tedious to correct mistakes

### Interaction styles: Question and Answer

- Advantages of question and answer interfaces:
    - Low memory requirements
    - Self-explanatory
    - Simple linear presentation
    - Easy for beginners
- Disadvantages of question and answer interfaces:
    - Require valid input supplied by user
    - Require familiarity with interface controls
    - Can be tedious to correct mistakes

### Interaction styles: Direct Manipulation⭐

- Ben Shneiderman (1982)
    - Continuous representations of the objects and actions of interest with meaningful visual metaphors
    - Physical actions or presses of labeled buttons instead of complex syntax.
    - Rapid, incremental, reversible actions whose effects on the objects of interest are visible immediately.
> 对于真正的意识，可能手势未结束、对话未结束时，已经理解含义。但AI一定是有停顿，结束后才能开始处理
- Three phases in Direct Manipulation - Cooper, Reimann (2003)
    - **Free Phase** -- How the screen looks before any user actions
    - **Captive Phase** -- How the screen looks during a user action (click, click-drag, etc.)
    - **Termination Phase** -- How the screen looks after a user action
- Direct Manipulation and the EEAC
    - The range of possible intentions is consistently wide
    - Users usually have multiple options for specifying action sequences
        - Can be overwhelming of novice users
    - Provide multiple ways of executing action sequences
- Advantages of direct manipulation interfaces:
    - Easy to learn
    - Low memory requirements
    - Easy to undo
    - ++Immediate feedback++ to user actions
    - Enables user to use spatial cues
    - Easy for beginners
- Disadvantages of direct manipulation interfaces:
    - Not self-explanatory
    - Inefficient use of screen real estate
    - High graphical system requirements
    
### Interaction styles: Metaphors

- GUIs use visual relationships to real-world objects (metaphors)
- Metaphors can help people relate to complex concepts and procedures by drawing on real-world knowledge
- Real-world affordances can be reflected
- What metaphors are used by contemporary GUIs?
- MAXIM: A metaphor's function must be consistent with real-world expectations
    - Metaphors that do not behave the way people expect will cause confusion and frustration
    - Macintosh trashcan

### Interaction styles: Web Navigation

- Two basic interaction styles
    - Link-based navigation
    - Search

### Interaction styles: 3D Environments

- 3D interaction is natural in the real-world
- 3D environments are common in digital games
- Rich graphical 3D environment are processor intensive
- 3D Navigation
    - Involves two types of movement
        - Translation -- movement on a plane
        - Rotation -- movement around an axis
- Web-based 3D
    - Use vector-based graphics to decrease file size
    - Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)
        - Uses polygons with parameters
    - X3D is XML based
        - Offers greater flexibility and control
    - WebGL

### Interaction styles: Natural Language

- Natural Language Interaction (NLI) -- Interacting with computers using everyday language
- Obstacles
    - Language is ambiguous
    - Meaning depends on context
    - Dependent on visual cues

### Interaction paradigms

- Another form of inspiration for conceptual models
- From the desktop to ubiquitous computing (embedded in the environment)

### Summary points

- Important to have a good understanding of the **problem space**
- Fundamental aspect of interaction design is to develop a **conceptual model**
- **Interaction modes** and **interface metaphors** provide a structure for thinking about which kind of conceptual model to develop
- **Interaction styles** are specific kinds of interfaces that are instantiated as part of the conceptual model
- **Interaction paradigms** can also be used to inform the design of the conceptual model
