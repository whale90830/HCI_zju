### What is Interaction Design: Recap

Designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives.

### Goals of Interaction Design: Recap

Develop usable products to allow users to carry out tasks
- Safely
- Effectively
- Efficiently
- Enjoyably

# Frameworks for Understanding Interaction

- A framework is basically a structure that provides a context for conceptualizing something.
- We can use these frameworks to:
    - Structure the design process
    - Help us to identify problematic areas within the design
    - Help us to conceptualize the problem space as a whole

### Execution/Evaluation Acion Cycle(EEAC)

- Donald Norman(1990) The Design of Everyday Things
- The structure of an action has four basic part:
    - **Goals**: We begin with some idea of what we want to happen; this is our goal.
    - **Execution**: We must then execute an action in the world.
    - **World**: To execute and action, we must manipulate objects in the world.
    - **Evaluation**: Finally, we must validate our action and compare the results with our goal.
- Goals do not specify particular actions
- Goals and intentions do not have a one-to-one, relationship
- "Delete text" goal
    - Intention that involves the Edit menu
    - Intention that involves the Delete key
- Each intention involves a sequence of actions

**Goal > Intention > Actions > Execution**

- Evaluate Results
    - Perceive new state
    - Interpret what we perceive
    - Evaluate new state with goal

**Perceive > Interpret > Evaluate**

##### Seven Stages of Action

- The seven stages form a cycle
- The cycle can be initiated at any point
    - Some goals are data-driven: initiated when an environmental event is perceived
    - Others are goal-driven: initated when the person conceives of a new goal

### Gulf of Execution

- Does the interface allows us to carry out the actions required by the intention?
    - **Goal** = save a file
    - **Intention** = use the file menu
    - **Action** = click the save option
- Is there a save option in the file menu?
- Given a particular interface design, how easily can you:
    - Determine the function of the device?
    - Determine what ctions are possible?
    - Determine mapping from intention to physical movement?
    - Perform the action?
    - Determine whether the system is in the desired state?
    - Determine the mapping form system state to interpretation?
    - Determine what state the system is in?

### Interaction Framework

- Abowd and Beale exoanded on the EEAC to include the system
- **System(S)** -- Uses its core language (computational attributes related to system state)
- **User(U)** -- Uses its task language (psychological attrbutes related to user state)
- **Input(I)** -- Uses its input language
- **Output(O)** -- Uses its output language

### Interaction Framework / EEAC

##### - Execution Phase
- **Artivulation** -- The user formulates a goal, which is then articulated using the input language.
- **Performance** -- The input language is translated into the core language (operations that the system will carry out).
- **Presentation** -- The system manifests the result of the core-language operations using the output language.

##### - Evaluation Phase
- **Observation** -- The user interprets the  results on the screen and reconciles them with the original goal.

### General Idea of a User Interface

![image](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/04/18/ES3VlF.md.png)

- A computer system involves communicaiton from a Designer to a User.
- Hopefully, the model intended by the designer is perceived by the user.

### User Interface Design Requires:

- Knowledge of People
- Knowledge about the Task
- Knowledge about Computers

> The 2nd part of this course is much more conceptual, informal and seemingly less technical than some of the courses you experience. This is because we must address the **human** aspects of interaction before we can provide satisfactory technical models and solutions.

### Knowledge of People Requires Knowledge of

- Cognitive psychology
    > E.g. limitation of human short-term memoty, gender differences
- Physical characteristics
    > E.g. poor eyesight, small children
- Human perceptual abilities
    > E.g. colour perception
- Language skills
- Learning ability
- Social interactions

### Goal in HCI: Universal Usability
> 期望做出具有无穷泛化能力的成果

- Address the needs of ALL users
- The computer is incidental to the design
- Achieve usability by considering humans and human needs as the driving force behind a design.
