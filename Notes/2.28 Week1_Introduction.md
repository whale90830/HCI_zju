### HCI

- What is it?
    - from MMI to HCI
- What happens when a human and a computer get together to perform a task
    - **task**: write document, calculate budget, solve equation, drive home, ...

### Why is this important?

- Computers (in one way or another) now affect every person in society
- Product success may depend on **ease** of use, not necessarily power
    > 算力已经没有那么重要

### Central topic

- Interaction design
    - Not just a software interface on a desktop monitor!
> Designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives.
>
> ——Jennifer Preece, Yvonne Rogers, Helen Sharp

### Goals of Interaction Design

- Allow **users** to carry out tasks
    - Safely
    
    - Effectively
        > **Having an intended or expected effect.**
        
    - Efficiently
        > - Acting directly to produce an effect
        > - **Acting or producing effectively with a minimum of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.**
    - Enjoyably
    
### Two Crucial Errors

- Assume all users are alike
    > 假设所有的用户一样 
- Assume all users are like the designer
    > 假设所有的用户与设计者一样

### Improving Interfaces

##### Know the User!
- Physical abilities
- Cognitive abilities *
- Skill differences
- Cultural diversity **
- Personality differences
- Motivation
- Special needs

### Aims of the course

- Consciousness raising
- Design Critic
- HCI foundations

## Design Critic

- Useless Design
- Bad Designs
    - Things that don't work the way you expect
    - Things that get in your way
    - Controls that have unexpected functions

##### Discussions: Good design or bad design

## Consciousness raising
