2. Would you know what to do if you had never encountered this device before?
3. How does the object afford?
4. Are controls visible?
5. Is there feedback?
6. What constraints are there?

### Usability: Recap

- Usability is a **quality measure** for a system.
- It is a dynamic, unpredictable process which requires understanding of
    - who the **users** are, and
    - their knowledge, **goals** and **tasks**.
- It is measured by different types of evaluation.

### Some Criteria for measuring Usability: Recap

- A. Time to complete a task
- B. Percent of task completed
- C. Percent task complete per unit time
- D. Ratio of success to failure
- E. Time spent in errors
- F. Percent or number of errors
- G. Percent or number of  competitors better than it
- H. Number of commands used
- ......

    - Make work effective, efficient and safer
    - Improve and enhance learning and training
    - Provide enjoyable and exciting entertainment
    - Enhance communication and understanding
    - Support new forms of creativity and expression
- Having a clear understanding of what, why, and how you are going to design something, before writing any code, can save enormous amounts of time and effort later on in the design process
    - Design an application to let people organize, store, and retrieve their email in a fast, efficient and enjoyable way

# Conceptual Model

### Understanding the problem space
> 做之前首先要明确问题

- What do you want to create?
    - A new UI for a given problem
    - A new UI and program for a given device
    - A new device for a given task
    - A new way of fulfilling a task
- Why do you want to do so?
- What are your assumptions?
    > 在什么基础上进行
- Will it achieve what you hope it will?


- A problem with trying to solve a design problem beginning at the "nuts and bolts" level is that critical usability goals and user needs may be overlooked
    - Consider the problem of providing drivers with better navigation and traffic information
        > 试图用AR提供导航，但低头不符合使用习惯，反而效果不好。试图在挡风玻璃上做AR导航，似乎也……

    - It is better to make these kind of design decisions after understanding the nature of the problem space.
- Clarifying your usability and user experiences goals is a central part of working out the problem space.
    - Make explicit your implicit assumptions and claims
> 有很多看似很好的想法，在真实的可用性表现上十分糟糕。所以明确usability和user experience的目标是求解问题空间的关键

### A framework for analysing the problem space

- Are there problems with an existing product?
    - What are they? List them explicitly!
    > 寻找痛点
- Why do you think there are problems?
    - You had them? Everybody has them?
    > 自己列出的问题未必真正成为问题
- Why do you think your proposed ideas might be useful?
    - Faster? Easier? More comfortable?
- How would you see people using it with their current way of doing things?
- How will it support peope in their activities?
- Will it really help them?

### An example

Assumptions:
- People want to use phones when on the way
- People need to carry the phone in their pockets
- People are comfortable with typing in the number
- People are comfortable with the form of a handset

### A couter-example

- What were the assumptions made by smart phone companies when developing WAP services?
- Was it a solution looking for a problem?
> 反问题：可能已经有一个技术，反问其适合什么问题

### Assumptions: realistic or wish-list?

- People want to be kept informed of up-to-date news wherever they are - **reasonable**
- Peope want to interact with information on the move - **reasonable**
- People are happy using a very small display and using an extremely restricted interface - **not reasonable**
- Peoplr will be happy doing thins on a smart phone that they normally do on their PCs (e.g. surf the web, read email, shop, bet, play video games) - **reasonable only for a very select bunch of users**

### From problem space to design space
> 怎样开始做设计

- Having a good understanding of the problem space can help inform the design space
    - e.g. what kind of interface, behavior, functionality to provide
- But before deciding upon these it is important to develop a **conceptual model**
> 设计应始于概念模型，要克制写程序的冲动，从纯理论的角度去思考问题

### Conceptual model

- Need to first think about how the system will appear to users (i.e. how they will understand it)
- The most important thing to design is the user's conceptual model
    - "Every thing else should be subordinated to making that model clear, obvious and substantial. That is almost exactly the opposite of how most software is designed."
    > 所有事情都应服务于让概念模型清晰明确具体。
- A conceptual model is a high level description of:
    - "the proposed system in terms of a set of integrated ideas and concepts about what it should do, behave and look like, that will be understandable by the users in the manner intended"
    > 高层抽象

### First steps in formulating a conceptual model

- What will the users be doing when carrying out their tasks?
- How will the system support these?
- What kind of interface metaphor, if any, will be appropriate?
- What kinds of interaciton modes and styles to use?

Always keep in mind when making design decisions how the user will **understand** and **remember** the underlying conceptual model

### Conceptual models

- Many kinds and ways of classifying them
- Here we describe them in terms of core activities and ovjects
- Also in terms of interface metaphors

### Conceptual model: example 1

- Considered "appropriate for middle school and high school school children
- 0: find marker for numbers on top side.
- 1: turn the knob to the **right 2 or more whole turns** and stop at the **first number** in your particular combination.
- 2: turn the knob to the **left one whole turn** past the first number, and stop at the **second number** in your combination.
- 3: turn the knob to the **right (\*\*Warning\*\*, not a complete whole turn!)** and stop at the last number in your combination.
- 4: Pull up on the shackle and turn the latch towards you.

**Congratulations**, the lock has been opened!

### Conceptual model: example 2

- 0: **Know** that numbers read from **top to bottom**, and **find** marker for numbers.
- 1: tunr **any** wheel in **any** direction to its correct number
- 2-4: **repeat** for all wheels
- 5: Pull up on the shackle and open

### Conceptual models: examples

**example 1**
- Objects: Body, knob, shackle
- Actions: Turn knob left/right, pull shackle

**example 2**
- Objects: Body, wheels, shackle
- Actions: Turn wheels left/right, pull shackle

### Conceptual models based on activities

- **Giving instrucitons**
    - issuing commands using keyboard and function keys and selecting options via menus
- **Conversing**
    - interacting with the system as if having a conversation
- **Manipulating and navigating**
    - acting on objects and interacting with virtual objects
- **Exploring and browsing**
    - finding out and learning things
> 以上四点几乎涵盖了用户的所有操作

#### 1. Giving instrucitons

- Where users instruct the system and tell it what to do
    - tell the time, print a file, save a file
- Very common conceptual model, underlying a diversity of devices and systems
    - e.g. CAD, word processors, vending machines
    > 指令是最最常见的用户活动
- Main benefit is that instructing supports quick and efficient interaction
    - good for repetitive kinds of actions performed on multiple objects
    > 最大的优点：快速高效

#### 2. Conversing

- Underlying model of having a conversation with another human
- Range from simple voice recognition menu-driven systems to more complex 'natural language' dialogues
- Examples include timetables, search engines, advice-giving systems, help systems
- Recently, much interest in having virtual agents at the interface, who converse with you.

##### Pros and cons of conversational model

- Allows users, especially novices and technophobes, to interact with the system in a way that is familiar
    - makes them feel comfortable, at ease and less scared
- Misunderstandings can arise when the system does not know how to parse what the user says

> 案例问题：假设每一步对话都顺利进行。不能归结为一个AI的错误，概念模型也没有问题，问题出现在实现中

#### 3. Manipulating and navigating

- Involves dragging, selecting, opening, closing and zooming actions on virtual objects
- Exploit's users' knowledge of how they move and manipulate in the physical world
- Exemplified by (i) what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) and (ii) the direct manipulation approach (DM)
- Shneiderman (1983) coined the term DM, came from his fascination with computer games at the time

##### Core principles of DM

- Continuous representation of objects and actions of interest of interest
- Physical actions and button pressing instead of issuing commands with complex syntax
- Rapid reversible actions with immediate feedback on object of interest
    > 即时反馈并支持快速逆操作

##### Why are DM interfaces so enjoyable?

- Novices can learn the basic functionality quickly 
- Experienced users can work ertiamaly rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions
- Intermittent users can retain operational concepts over time
- Error messages rarely needed
- Users can immediately see if their actions are furthering their goals and if not do something else
- Users experience less anxiety 
- Users gain confidence and mastery and feel in control

##### What are the disadvantages with DM?

- Some people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally
- Not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly
- Some tasks are better achieved through delegating 
    - e g.spell checking
- Can become screen space 'gobblers' (waste extensive screen space)
- Moving a mouse around the screen can be slower than pressing function keys to do same actions

#### 4. Exploring and browsing

- Similar to how people browse information with existing media (e.g. newspapers, magazines libraries, pamphlets)
- Information is structured to allow flexibility in way user is able to search for information
    - e.g.multimedia, web

### Class Activity

A company is building a wireless information system to help tourists find their way around an unfamiliar city. What would they need to find out in order to develop a conceptual model?

### Conceptual models based on objects

- Usually based on an analogy with something in the physical world
- Examples include books, tools, vehicles
- Classic: Xerox Star Interface based on office objects
- Another classic: the spreadsheet (Bricklin)
    - Analogous to ledger (分类账) sheet
    - Interactive and computational
    - Easy to understand
    - Greatly extending what accountants and others could do

### Which conceptual model is best?

- **Direct manipulation** is good for **doing** types of tasks, e.g. designing, drawing, flying, driving, sizing windows
- Issuing **instructions** is good for **repetitive** tasks, e.g. spell-checking, file management
- Having a **conversation** is good for children, computer-phobic, disabled users and specialised applications (e.g. **phone** services)
- Hybrid conceptual models are often employed, where **different ways of carrying out the same actions** is supported at the interface - but can take longer to learn

### Interface metaphors

- Interface designed to be similar to a physical entity but also has own properties
    - e.g. desktop metaphor, web portals
- Can be based on activity, object or a combination of both
    - e.g. W3 is an ocean.(surfing, drowning in a sea of information)
    > activities与objects组合成metaphors
- Exploit user's familiar knowledge, helping them to understand 'the unfamiliar'
    > 用一些熟悉的概念帮助理解界面是如何运作的
- Conjures up the essence of the unfamiliar activity, enabling users to leverage of this to understand more aspects of the unfamiliar functionality

#### Benefits of interface metaphors

- Makes learning new systems easier
    > 最大的好处就是帮助理解
- Helps users understand the underlying conceptual model
- Can be very innovative and enable the realm of computers and their applications to be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users

#### Problems with interface metaphors

- Break conventional and cultural rules
    - e.g, recycle bin placed on desktop
    > 使用不恰当会反常识
- Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space
- Conflict with design principles
- Forces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor 
- Designers can inadvertently(不经意地) use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over
- Limits designers' imagination in coming up with new conceptual models
