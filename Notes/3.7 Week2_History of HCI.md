### Recap: Interaction Design

- Interaction Design
    - Designing interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives.
- Goals of ID
    - Allows **users** to carry out **tasks** safely, effectively, efficiently, and enjoyably.

### Recap: Why is HCI important?

- Computers (in one way or another) now affect every person in society
- Product success may depend on **ease** of use, not necessarily power

### Why study human use of computers?

- HCI is worth studying because it  aligns both human interests and economic interests.
- The HCI discipline includes the study of:
    - the use and context of computers
    - human characterstics
    - computer system and interface architecture
    - the development process

# History of HCI
> key people, events and ideas

### Main theme

- human->computer
- ↓
- computer->human
> 由人适应计算机发展为计算机适应人，未来可能向人机融合发展，而非谁适应谁

### Five stages

- Manual work
    > 狭义的手工作业阶段，如算盘
- Command line
> 第一次人机交互革命 ↓
- GUI
- Network UI
- Multi-modal UI
    > 第二次人机交互革命
    > - Natural use interface, NUI
    > - 通过多模态（各种感官通道）形成与计算机自然的交互
    > - 对NUI概念要慎重，尚未讨论清楚
    > - Intelligent use interface, IUI

### Input/Output devices

##### The lesson

- Keyboards & terminals are just **artifacts** of today's technologies
    > artifact: 人造物->我们或许也可以某种程度上改变世界
- New input/output devices will change the way we interact with computers

### Basic Interactions

- Direct Manipulation of graphical objects
    > direct Manipulation 有学术定义
- The Mouse
- Windows
    > 工作空间

### Vannevar Bush (1890-1974)

- "As we may think" article in Atlantic Monthly
    > 建议阅读 https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/
- Identified the information storage and retrieval problem: new knowledge does not reach the people who could benefit from it.
    > "publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record"
- Bush's Memex
    - Conceiving Hypertext and the World Wide Web
        - a device where individuals stores all personal books, records, communication.etc
        - items retrieved rapidly through indexing, keywords, cross references,...
        - can annotate text with margin notes comments...
        - can construct and save a trail (chain of links) through the material
        - acts as an external memory
    - Bush's Memex based on microfilm recorder
        - but not implemented

> - 布什认为世界是模糊的，应当以模糊的方式来处理，所以他不支持数字计算机
> - ↑ 涉及到世界认知的本源问题——如果世界的本源是离散的，那么离散建模没有问题；如果世界的本源并非离散，那么有可能现在阶段的建模是完全错误的

### J.C.R. licklider (1915-1990)

- "Computing's Johnny Appleseed"
- His ideas foretold of **graphical computing, point-and-click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and software that would exist on a network and migrate to wherever it was needed**.
- Outlined "man-computer symbiosis"
- Immediate goals
    - time sharing of computers among many users
        > 分时技术
    
    - electronic i/o for the display and communication of symbolic and pictorial information
    - interactive real time system for information processing and programming
    - large scale information storage and retrieval
        > 目前其实仍未做到
    
    - facilitation of human cooperation in the design & programming of large systems
    - combined speech recognition, hand-printed character recognition & light-pen editing
- Long tem visions
    - natural language understanding (syntax, semantics, pragmatics)
        - syntax 语法：The study of the rules whereby words or other elements of sentence
        - semantics 语义：The study or science of meaning in language forms
        - pragmatics 语用：The study of language as it is used in a social context and affects the interlocutors(对话者) and their behavior
    - speech recognition of arbitrary computer users
    - heuristic programming

### Ivan Sutherland's SketchPad

> 发明了用光笔在屏幕上可以作CAD图形，成为计算机图形学&计算机辅助设计的奠基人

- Sophisticated drawing package
- Introduced many ideas/concepts now found in today's interface
    - **hierarchical structures** defined pictures and sub-pictures
    - **object-oriented programming**: master pictures with instances
    - **constraints**: specify details which the system maintains through changes
    - **icons**: small pictures that represented more complex items
    - **copying**: both pictures and constraints
    - **input techniques**: efficient use of light pen
    - **world coordinates**: separation of screen from drawing coordinates
    - **recursive operations**: applied to children of hierarchical objects
- Parallel developments in hardware
    - "low-cost" graphics terminals
    - input devices such as data tablets
    - display processors capable of real-time manipulation of images
    - HMD
    - ACM Turning Award

### Douglas Engelbart

- The problem (early '50s)
    > - "... The world is getting more complex, and problems are getting more urgent. These must be dealt with collectively. However, human abilities to deal collectively with complex/urgent problems are not increasing as fast as these problems"
    > - "If you could do something to improve human capability to deal with these problems, then you'd really contribute something basic."
    > - 探讨知识爆炸问题->中国较美国的知识爆炸期晚了约40年
- A Conceptual Framework for Augmenting Human Intellect (SRI Report, 1962)
